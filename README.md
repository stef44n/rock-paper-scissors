js basics

After finishing this project I will be able to write basic scripts in JS and have a better grasp of the language.
I will very likely need to debug the program in order to make sure it works as intended and improve my problem solving skills.
I will also comment in some pseudocode to act as a foundation for the upcoming code and to make it easier to accomplish the project.
